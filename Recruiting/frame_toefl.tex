        \item There is significant concern among most program advisors that there is inflation in these scores
        \item TOEFL is \textcolor{red!50!black}{not} typically used to rank applicants
        \item \textcolor{green!40!black}{However:} the TOEFL score is an absolute requirement for applicants from non-English-speaking countries.
