\begin{frame}[fragile]{Recommenders}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Three to five professors who can say nice things about you 
        \item You provide contact information and the application system makes the letter requests directly
        \item Be sure to ask each one if they are willing to be a recommender, and inform them of what programs you are applying to
        \item If possible, meet with each one specifically to discuss your application plans; they may have good advice.
        \item Avoid asking job supervisors, post-docs, grad students to be recommenders
        \item A letter from an undergraduate research advisor is highly recommended
    \end{itemize}
