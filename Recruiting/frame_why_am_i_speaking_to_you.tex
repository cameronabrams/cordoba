\begin{frame}[fragile]{Why am I talking to you?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Humanity needs more STEM PhDs (excepting computer science) 
    \item Hundreds of STEM PhD programs in the US depend on a steady supply of well-prepared and talented students
    \item STEM graduates from Latin America are usually exceptionally well-trained and qualified for graduate school
    \item Latin Americans are underrepresented among non-US PhD student in the US (and they are mostly Brazilians)
    \item We would \ul{love} to see more applicants to US PhD programs from Argentina
\end{itemize}
