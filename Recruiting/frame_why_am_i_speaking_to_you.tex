\begin{frame}[fragile]{Why am I talking to you?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The world needs more STEM PhDs (except from computer science) 
    \item Hundreds of STEM PhD programs in the US depend on a steady supply of well-prepared and talented students
    \item STEM undergraduates from Latin America are usually exceptionally well-trained and well-qualified for graduate school
    \item Latin Americans are underrepresented among international students in the US (since 90\% of international students are from China and India)
    \item Argentines are underrepresented among non-US students from South America
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Fun fact: As a share of national populations, Brazil has 12\% more international students in the US than Argentina (BRA 73 ppm - ARG 68 ppm), but only 2\% more head-to-head goals (BRA 166 - ARG 162) (includes unofficial matches)
    \end{itemize}
    \item We would \ul{love} to see more applicants to US PhD programs from Argentina
\end{itemize}
