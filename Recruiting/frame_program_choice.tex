\begin{frame}[fragile]{Choosing a Program}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose programs based on the disciplinary home(s) of the research topics that interest you
    \item Most research topics ``belong'' to more than one program
    \item Faculty with primary appointment in a department that does not house a particular program can often advise students in that program (I can advise students in Biochemistry, for example)
\end{itemize}
