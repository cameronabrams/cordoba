\begin{frame}[fragile]{PhD Application Fees}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most universities require applicants to pay a fee to apply (US\$10-100)
        \item Fee payment is usually the last checkpoint after which the university lets graduate program advisors ``see'' applications
        \item Many programs waive application fees; if it is not clear, then ask the grad program advisor!
    \end{itemize}
