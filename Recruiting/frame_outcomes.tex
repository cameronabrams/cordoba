\begin{frame}[fragile]{Application outcomes}
The first outcome of every application you submit is one of three possibilities
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rejection
    \item Waitlist placement
    \item Offer
\end{itemize}

We typically reject applications because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Missing some necessary component (``incompletes'')
    \item Weak grades in important technical courses
    \item No undergraduate research experience
    \item No letter of recommendation even though there is research experience
    \item Poor quality personal statements
    \item Lack of good information on the applicant's home institution
\end{itemize}
