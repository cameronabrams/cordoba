\begin{frame}[fragile]{Should you go for a PhD?  Ask yourself:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Do I like doing research? (Maybe you are already doing it as an undergraduate!)
    \item Do I want to be a professional scientist?
    \item Do I like the idea of solving humanity's problems?
    \item Do I enjoy challenging myself by learning cutting-edge stuff?
    \item Am I creative and imaginative?
    \item Do I like teaching others difficult stuff?
    \item Am I persistent in the face of repeated setbacks?
    \item Am I willing to defer a STEM professional salary for a few years?
\end{itemize}
