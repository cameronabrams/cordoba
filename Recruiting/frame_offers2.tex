\begin{frame}[fragile]{Offers can come out of sync!}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You may get an offer from one institution before you know your application status at another.  What do you do?  My personal recommendation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Take the offer! You should not apply to a school whose offer you would not seriously consider
        \item Let other place you have applied to know so they can drop your application
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
