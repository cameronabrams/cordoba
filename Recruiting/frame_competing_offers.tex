\begin{frame}[fragile]{Competing Offers: What to do?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Availability of several potential research projects
        \item Stipend level
        \item Any bonuses or scholarships
        \item Any contact you have had with faculty in the program
    \end{itemize}
    \item Last and most important: if one of the competing offers is from Drexel, come to Drexel!
\end{itemize}
