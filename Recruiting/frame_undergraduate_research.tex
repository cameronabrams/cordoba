\begin{frame}[fragile]{Undergraduate Research Experience}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most STEM PhD programs in the US highly value undergraduate research experience in applicants
        \item Meaningful undergraduate research experiences provide a lot of inspiration for personal statements
        \item Getting your name among the list of authors on a publication can be very valuable, but only if you can clearly describe how you contributed
        \item Undergraduate research can compensate for less than stellar grades on your transcript
    \end{itemize}
