    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are 146 R1 universities in the US
        \item Pick $\sim$10 based on location to investigate to see if they have a program for you
    \end{itemize}
    \item Talk to your professors; they may have direct knowledge of US institutions and programs
    \item Log into online ``open houses'' from programs, departments, or colleges.  Sometimes these are live and sometimes pre-recorded.
    \item Stay organized!  
\end{itemize}
