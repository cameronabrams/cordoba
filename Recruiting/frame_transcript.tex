\begin{frame}[fragile]{Some thoughts about transcripts}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most applicants have very good transcripts, mostly A's
        \item B's or C's are not necessarily going to lead to a rejection; depends on 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textcolor{blue!30}{what courses} they are in; if math, chemistry, physics, or major courses, this is somewhat concerning; 
            \item \textcolor{green!60!black}{when} they occur; early is OK, late is not so good
        \end{itemize}
        \item Elective courses that show your interests can be a plus
    \end{itemize}
