\begin{frame}[fragile]{The Waitlist \textcolor{yellow!80!black}{(Lista de espera)}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Applications that are acceptable but rank below the topmost applicants in one or more metric
    \item Applications are ranked on the waitlist
    \item Any offer that comes back as not accepted opens up a slot for the next applicant on the waitlist
    \item Once the number of acceptances is met, the waitlist is dissolved and all applications on it are rejected
    \item An acceptance in one program is almost infinitely better than a waitlist placement at another, even if the waitlist institution is ``better''
\end{itemize}
