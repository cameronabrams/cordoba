\begin{frame}[fragile]{Your Personal Statement: Some Guidance}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is important! Put real time into writing it
        \item Describe
        \begin{itemize}
            \item what motivates you to pursue a PhD (e.g., career goals and/or research)
            \item what research topics you are particularly interested in and why;
            \item what professors in the program look most interesting to you
        \end{itemize}
        \item Try to keep it under one page, 11 pt font
        \item Don't worry if your English is not perfect; we are looking past English mistakes for clarity of expression
        \item Do not use ChatGPT or any other generative AI tool. We see this a lot and it is easy to spot (so far).
        \item Professors and mentors at your undergraduate institution should be happy to review drafts of your statement (I do this for every Drexel senior who asks)
    \end{itemize}
