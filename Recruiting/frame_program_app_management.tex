\begin{frame}[fragile]{PhD Program Application Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Most programs begin evaluating applications late in Fall terms (before December), even if their deadlines are much later
        \item Most offers are made between December 1 and April 30 for PhD positions beginning the following September
        \item Getting applications in early in this process is a good idea -- try for October or November of your final undergraduate year
        \item Programs often reach out to international applicants for pre-decision interviews -- this means they are very interested in you
        \item If you accept another offer, it is considered polite to inform other places you have applied so they stop bothering you
    \end{itemize}
