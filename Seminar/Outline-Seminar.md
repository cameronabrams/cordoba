### Modern Molecular Simulations using Extended-Lagrangian Approaches

1. Introduction
   - Time and length scales of some selected phenomena
   - The atomic theory and modeling reality atomistically
   - Molecular dynamics simulations
     - Basics
     - Sampling and ergodicity
     - The essential problem
2. Extended Lagrangian Methods
   - TAMD
     - Example: HIV gp120
   - TAMD/OTFP
     - Example 1: HIV Env/DAVEI
     - Example 2: Prion
     - Example 3: Kv
   - String Method
     - Example 1: Gas pathways in proteins
     - Example 2: Climbing strings
3. Markovian Milestoning
   - Example: Enzyme substrate transport kinetics
4. Conclusion
   - Collective variables are still a major problem
   - High CV-space dimensionality is a problem
